Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reconstruction of rational functions based on modular arithmetic methods
 is an established field of mathematics.
 Its main idea is that a rational function in multiple variables can be
 reconstructed from the knowledge of its values modulo a prime with the
 variables set to fixed numbers
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "vonzurGathen:2013"

\end_inset

.
 Because modular evaluation is a comparatively fast operation, these methods
 enable one to sidestep the complexity and the intermediate expression swell
 associated with simplifying the expressions symbolically (i.e.
 using the approaches of the traditional computer algebra systems).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an illustration of a simpler case (polynomial reconstruction), with the
 knowledge of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(11)=606\left(\mathrm{mod}\,997\right)\qquad\text{and}\qquad f(38)=827\left(\mathrm{mod}\,997\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

one can use Lagrange interpolation and rational number reconstruction

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x)=606\frac{x-38}{11-38}+827\frac{x-11}{38-11}=996+599x=-1+\frac{4}{5}x\left(\mathrm{mod}\,997\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This form can then be double-checked (or possibly improved) with more evaluation
s of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\,\mathrm{mod}\,n$
\end_inset

.
 Similar methods have also been developed for rational functions

\begin_layout Section
The

\end_layout

\end_inset

 approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical IBP-solving tool based on modular arithmetics generates the needed
 linear equations, and then repeatedly solves them via Gaussian elimination
 modulo a 63-bit prime with the variables set to large random values.
 The (integer) values of the coefficients in the final row-reduced form
 are used to reconstruct them as rational expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is our observation that a typical IBP solver spends the majority of its
 time—as much as 90% of it—managing its data structures used to represent
 the equations, rather than performing modular arithmetics.
 Fortunately, it is possible to forgo these data structures altogether:
 if instead of solving the linear system each time anew, one would trace
 it and record each arithmetic operation performed during the Gaussian eliminati
on (as e.g.

\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

), then for subsequent evaluations there is no need to re-run the original
 algorithm—only this list of operations.
 We shall call such a list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Emph
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
a trace
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Evaluating a trace instead of the original algorithm immediately eliminates
 the overhead of managing data structures, and allows one to store all the
 needed intermediate values in a tightly packed linear region of memory,
 improving the performance further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is an implementation of this idea.
 It consists of a small C++ library, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ratracer.h
\end_layout

\end_inset

, used to record traces of arbitrary user-defined calculations, and the
 command-line tool, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

, used to simplify and reconstruct traces, as well as parse arithmetic expressio
ns and solve linear systems of equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trace files 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 works on are stored in a custom binary format optimized for performance
 and convenience; essence the format simply contains a list of arithmetic
 operations with the output values specially marked.
 For example, an expression like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $2\times x+3$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could be encoded as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

location #1 = integer 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

location #2 = variable 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

location #3 = product of location #1 and #2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

location #4 = integer 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

location #5 = sum of location #3 and #4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

save location #5 as output 1
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

Having recordings of operations as a standalone object comes with multiple
 advantages.

\end_inset

 can:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 output (

dead code
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, e.g.
 redundant equations), folding constants (i.e.
 replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times3$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

), simplifying operations (i.e.
 replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times x$
\end_inset

 by just
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

), merging common subexpressions, and reshuffling the temporary locations
 to minimize the memory usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reconstruct a trace with a subset of its variables set to integers, rationals,
 or arbitrary expressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select a subset of a trace's outputs and drop the rest, so that instead
 of reconstructing the whole set of resulting coefficients it would be possible
 to reconstruct any subset.
 The idea here is that evaluating a subset is faster than evaluating the
 whole set (after dead code elimination); this also allows to easily parallelize
 the whole reconstruction across multiple computers: each can work on reconstruc
ting its own subset of outputs.
 This way one can achieve an equivalent of master-wise reduction, sector-wise
 reduction, or any mixture of these by just choosing which outputs to keep
 in which trace files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Expand the outputs of a trace in a series (without performing reconstruction).
 Because the outputs in a trace file are just trees of arithmetic expressions,
 any operation that makes sense on arithmetic expressions makes sense on
 a trace file too.
 Expanding a trace in a series has two immediate uses:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
automatically calculating derivatives of IBP coefficients without reconstructing
 them;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
increasing the reconstruction performance by expanding IBP coefficients
 into series in a small parameter (e.g.
 the dimensional regulator
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, or a small mass ratio), and throwing away higher orders—if those are deemed
 to not be needed in practice.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The main disadvantage is the size of the trace files: because it grows with
 the number of the required operations, for problems of interest it can
 go into the gigabyte range, making it impractical to keep it in the memory.
 For this reason 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 makes sure that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
During trace recording (i.e.
 expression tracing or equations solving) the operations are not kept in
 the memory, but are progressively written to disk instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
During optimization transformations the whole trace is never fully loaded
 into the memory—it is read in chunks from the disk instead—and the memory
 requirement of temporary data structures used during the transformation
 is never proportional to the number of operations, but is at most proportional
 to the memory size required to evaluate the trace (which is always assumed
 to fit into the memory).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This makes the algorithms used for these optimizations more complicated,
 and limits transformations like common expression elimination to work on
 a subset of the code at a time, rather than being global.
 Still, 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 manages to work within this constraint well.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
During the evaluation the trace is never fully loaded into memory (unless
 specifically allowed by the user), and is instead read in chunks from the
 disk.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We have found that the time to read a very large trace from a solid-state
 drive is less than the time needed to evaluate the corresponding trace,
 so the overhead is not great, but the parallel evaluation is limited by
 this for larger traces.
 We do not however believe this to be a principal limitation, as additional
 ways to improve the parallelizability of very large traces can be developed.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In our experience complicated IBP reductions like massive 5-point 2-loop
 problems (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

) fit well under several gigabytes, and thus are not limited by the trace
 sizes.

Reconstruction with kinematics set to constants

\begin_layout Standard
With

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 it is possible to set variables to some expressions (e.g.
 constants) before loading a trace, so that the trace would use that as
 its input.
 One use of this functionality is to evaluate the IBP reduction coefficients
 at particular fixed values of the kinematic invariants.
 This can be done the following way:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the reconstruction is performed in only one variable: 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, because all the other variables are now fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another use of this feature is to perform reconstruction on a particular
 line (or, more generally, hypersurface) in the kinematic parameter space.
 For example, we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}^{2}=3/5\lambda$
\end_inset

 and

A major increase in reconstruction performance can be obtained by noting
 that fairly often the dimensional parameter

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 enters the reconstructed expressions at a fairly high power (as 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{6}$

 in the case of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:diamond2l-detailed"

), but in practice most of this information is not needed: what is needed
 is the expansion of the coefficients in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 (with 
\begin_inset Formula $d=4-2\epsilon$
\end_inset

), and only the first few terms of it, up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{1})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{0})$
\end_inset

 usually, so restoring the dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{6}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{6}$
\end_inset

 Fortunately, we can avoid this waste by expanding the coefficients into

\begin_layout Standard
The performance effect of this expansion is two-fold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, the variable in which the expansion is made is removed from the reconstru
ction, making it faster (fewer probes are required).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Second, more outputs are needed and their per-probe evaluation time might
 be larger than that of the original problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice this works out so that expanding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{0})$
\end_inset

 improves the overall reconstruction time by a factor of 2–5; less so for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1})$
\end_inset

, and if a high enough expansion order is requested, then there is no performanc
e benefit.
 For this reason it is important to specify the expansion order as low as
 is practically needed.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $CO[\text{diamond}_{1,1,1,1,3},\text{diamond}_{0,1,1,1,1}]$
\end_inset

 is only needed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{0}$
\end_inset

), but the other coefficients are needed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1}$
\end_inset

), we can expand everything up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1}$
\end_inset

) and then remove the coefficients we don't need:

 We believe the 5x improvement demonstrated for challenging reductions such
 as massive five-point two-loop topologies is already enough for 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to be a valuable option for problems at the boundary of what is practical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future we envision several ways to improve the performance of 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 further.
 First, seeing that with the fast probe times that 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ratracer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 often provides the overhead in the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 library becomes a limiting factor, we see improvements in 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
FireFly
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to reduce that overhead as an important potential speedup source.
 Second, when solving linear equation systems it is possible to achieve
 smaller (and therefore faster) traces by spending the time to devise better
 equation elimination orders.
 Third, optimizing the traces further to make the memory access pattern
 more linear could improve the performance of traces with large memory usage.

 Reduction is requested for all 9719 integrals with at most one numerator
 and one dot.
 The solvers are asked to use a fixed master integral basis which is specificall

 Because the reduction is fairly complicated, the values of all kinematic
 and mass parameters are set to numerical values on a particular line in
 the parameter space, leaving only the dimensional regulator

 This task simulates the reduction needed to obtain differential equations
 for the master integrals along a particular line.
